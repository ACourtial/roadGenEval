These informations are present on all page of the survey so do not hesitate to read it again when you think it is nessecary. <br>


<section class="def"> <h2>Definition</h2>

  The mountain road generalization combined: turn enlargement, shape smoothing and simplifying; in order to avoid symbol coalescence.
