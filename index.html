<h2>Welcome to my survey. </h2>

The goal of this survey is to evaluate serveral technics to generalize roads shape in map.  <br>It should take you about <b>twenty minutes</b>.<br>

<br>

We will present you images of roads generalized via traditional method at IGN (the french national map agency) and images of generalised roads produce by artificial inteligence (AI) and especially deep learning. This approach aims to provide many example of generalization to a deep neural network in order to extract a proposses that directly produce an image of generalisation. <Br>
<br>First here is a definition of map generalization and a list a caracteristic of mountain roads genralisation. Then you can find some explanation about the presented images.
These informations are present on all page of the survey so do not hesitate to read it again when you think it is nessecary. <br>


<section class="def"> <h2>Definition</h2>
  Map generalisation seeks to adapt a precise geographic dataset for visualisation at a smaller scale. It should provide readable map and conserve the information.<br>
  <img src="images\gen.png" class="img3"><br>
  Here is an example of illustration of map generealization from (Barrault et al, 2001), it represent the generalization of the database BD Topo Â® at 1 : 50 000 on a city area by AGENT process. <br>
  <BR>The mountain road generalization combined the following process in order to avoid symbol coalescence.<br>

<h2>Data</h2>
The intial image came from the database of roads of the french national map agency (IGN) and are detailled for a display at 1:25 000 scale.
The target scale is 1:250 000. All images are represented at the same scale in a 2.5km large square. Roads width represent the importance of the road.
